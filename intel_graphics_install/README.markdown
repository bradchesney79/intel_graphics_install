# intel_graphics_install #

This is the intel_graphics_install module. It currently provides a way to install the latest and greatest from the open source Intel video drivers repositories-- I took a peek at it out of curiosity. I think aside from an ancient apt module dependency, I think it should work okay...

I have logic to allow Fedora to be installed similarly but it is not populated with any useful code. Feel free to fork and do magic. I'll happily accept any worthwhile pull requests.
